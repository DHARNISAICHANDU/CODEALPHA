                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is DHARNI SAICHANDU, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree at MLR Institute of Technology and Management (MLRITM) in Hyderabad. I hail from Goliwada, Peddapalli District, Telangana, where I completed my intermediate education at Telangana State Model Junior College (TSMJC). This formative period was crucial in shaping my academic interests and career aspirations.
                        Since relocating to Hyderabad, I have immersed myself in the diverse and dynamic environment of MLRITM. My studies focus on Computer Science, where I am keen on exploring innovative technologies and solving complex problems. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I am developing a robust technical foundation.
                        In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively engage in extracurricular activities such as sports and tech clubs. These experiences allow me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and collaborate with peers who share similar interests. I am particularly interested in software development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, which I believe will drive my future career path.
                        Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading, coding, and playing sports. These activities provide a well-rounded balance to my academic life and help me stay motivated and focused. My time in Hyderabad has been both challenging and enriching, and I am enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead.
                        Looking forward, I am committed to leveraging my education and experiences to contribute effectively to the technology sector and to make a positive impact through my work.
